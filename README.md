# MIT License
### In this project I chose the MIT license
**Advantage:**
_The MIT License is extremely permissive, allowing anyone to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the code without imposing significant restrictions. This encourages collaboration and adoption of your project_
**Disadvantage:**
_The permissiveness of the MIT License means that someone could potentially take your open-source project, make substantial improvements to it, and release a proprietary version without sharing those improvements with the community._
